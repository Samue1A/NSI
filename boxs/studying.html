            <h2 class="white">My tips and tricks:</h2>
            <ul class="protect">
                <li class="white">Take an interest in the material. If you actually take an interest in the material you will learn with much more ease and you will be more than happy to study on the material</ class="white">
                <li class="white">Actually listen in class. I know everybody thinks that they listen in class but there are different degrees of listening, if sit away from your friends an devote all of your attention to the lesson at hand you will be able to remember it and fully understand it. I always devote all of my attention to the lessons which allows me to remember lessons from five years ago.</li>
                <li class="white">I give myself a detailed schedule that is just barely impossible in the allotted time. The fact that it's impossible prevents me from having anything to slack off and the fact that it's barely impossible stops me from quitting.  </li>
                <li class="white">Don't be satisfied with what you have. If you want good grades to the extent that you would be willing to sacrifice your mental health this is a great tip. I never let myself be satisfied which motivates me to work very hard and hard work leads to good grades.</li>
                <li class="white">Be prepared. Map out what you're going to do and when. You want everything to be planned so that you know exactly what to do and when. If you have a problem with nerves having a plan will really help.</li>
                <li class="white">Get a good night's sleep. This is a well-known secret but most people still don't do it, if you are one of those people I recommend the book "why we sleep" by Matthew Walker PhD. After reding the book you will gain a greater appreciation for sleep and you will understand why you must sleep. If you have trouble going to sleep and stay in your bed long before you fall asleep a rigid sleep schedule might help.</li>
